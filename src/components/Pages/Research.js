Luisa Hulsrøj: "It's better not to just label people"

At the University of Cambridge, doctoral student Luisa Hulsrøj, with the support of the DAAD, 
initiated a workshop on how German, American and British societies should deal with right-wing 
extremist tendencies. The view across the border shapes the historian's curriculum vitae: 
The 24-year-old has Danish roots, was born in Germany, grew up in Vienna and studied at Stanford.

Ms. Hulsrøj, 
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>how did you come up with the idea of organizing a workshop on how to deal with the extreme right?</h3>

Luisa Hulsrøj: In the summer of 2017, I was reading a collection of autobiographical texts by National 
Socialists for my studies when the riots in Charlottesville, USA, occurred: Following a demonstration by 
neo-Nazis, several people died there. An American friend asked me what I thought of the militant practices of 
Antifa in the Weimar Republic. I told her that in 600 autobiographical texts I had not found a single indication 
that someone turned away from National Socialism after being beaten up or threatened. On the contrary, the extremists 
then felt confirmed in their role as victims. We thought about alternative strategies – that's how the idea for a workshop came about.
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>
Who were you able to win as speakers?</h3>

Among the speakers were the American political scientist Ira Katznelson and the British anti-terror expert Craig McCann, 
the political scientist Rebecca Pates from the University of Leipzig and the sociologist Anna-Lena Herkenhoff. In the 
administrative district of Münster, she advises people who are confronted with right-wing extremism. It has been shown 
that the reasons that promoted the rise of National Socialism 80 years ago still play a role today – for example, that 
people feel disadvantaged who actually are not. In the past, National Socialists voted less for the unemployed, but for 
those who were afraid of losing their jobs. This is very similar today with the right-wing populists.
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>
Can Americans, British and Germans learn from each other in the fight against extremism?</h3>

The conditions are very different. Thus, Germany has a complicated relationship with the concept of the nation,
 which makes it easy for the AfD to occupy it. In Great Britain and the USA, on the other hand, patriotism is broadly 
 anchored in society. However, all speakers agreed that it is better not to simply label and exclude people who are 
 attracted to right-wing extremism. One should take seriously the reasons for their attitude. Politically, by reducing 
 poverty and disadvantage. On a personal level, by trying to talk to them without accepting their ideology. This is a 
 difficult balancing act – in all countries.
<br/>

<h3>
The topic of National Socialism has occupied you for a long time. You wrote your bachelor thesis on ethnic Germans in Denmark.</h3>

Unlike in the Sudetenland, the Danish border region was never formally annexed by the German Reich. It remained part of 
an independent Danish state. But even when it was obvious that Germany would lose the war, the ethnic Germans in Denmark 
remained ardent supporters of National Socialism. As late as March 1945, volunteers enlisted in the Waffen-SS.
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>
Do you also take up the topic in your doctoral thesis?
</h3>
Yes, I deal with National Socialism between 1930 and 1933 in border regions, including on the German side of the Danish 
border. My thesis is that the fear for the existence of the border and the strengthening of National Socialism went hand 
in hand. Many Germans – for example in East Prussia – feared being annexed to a neighbouring state after Germany had to 
cede numerous territories after the First World War.

The DAAD-University of Cambridge Research Hub for German Studies supported your workshop. A good experience?

The support was very valuable, also with regard to the conception of the workshop. I had heard a 
talk by Chris Young, one of two directors of the Research Hub. He encouraged doctoral students to 
approach him with ideas for events. The other director of the hub is my doctoral supervisor Christopher Clark, 
who became known far beyond the disciplinary boundaries through the book "The Sleepwalkers" about the First World War. 
He is a DAAD alumnus and encouraged me to use the help of the hub. Without them, the event would not have come about. The 
faculty could not have funded it because it was not directly involved in my research, but the DAAD was quite open to it.
